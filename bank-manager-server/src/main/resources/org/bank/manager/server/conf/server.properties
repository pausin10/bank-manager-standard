#Configuration file where the main parameters to connect with the server are defined. 
#The Client needs three of these parameters to connect with the server: the hostname, the registry port and the registry name.
#With these three parameters the server definition is unique. 
#Name of the machine that will contain the Application Server, that is, the machine where the server is running. 
#By default, localhost will be apply:
Hostname=localhost

LocatorProperties=org/bank/manager/server/conf/locator.properties
#Register port that will use the other remote objects that the server will create, that is, where remote objects (entities and locator) 
#are listening. If this parameter is not defined, a random port is used:
RemoteObjectPort=49015
